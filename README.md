# My Notes
 
This is a crud application that lets a add, store, edit and delete data. 

it has bootstrapp links for responsiveness and it's built with an event listner that sends back result when an event "clicking the button" happen. there's a prevent default that prevents the page from refreshing. kindliy use the link to run the project. constructive criticsm is highly appreciated.
Thanks,
